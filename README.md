# Introduction

Chip is an easy to use chat-leveling bot for you personal Discord server! You may run your own using this code, or run the pre-hosted one!

## Downloading The Jar (Requires A Java IDE, Java 8 JDK, and Git):

  - Clone the Chip Repository, and add to your IDE.
  - Run Chip as a `Maven Build` with goals of `clean install`.
  - Production Jar-> `Project-Folder/target/Chip-X.jar`
  
## Pre-Set-Up Information:

Chip does require a MySQL backend to run properly. The bot will fail to start without one.

## Set-Up Information:

To set up the bot's config, just launch the jar once to generate it! If you are using the hosted bot, no set-up is required! Otherwise, be sure to enter your own Bot's token, as well as the correct MySQL information.

## Starting The Bot (finally!)

Starting your bot is super easy! Just launch the bot with terminal or command-prompt. If the bot shuts off, be sure the SQL and bot token are entered into the config correctly. Then retry!


## Usage
